## üîç **Initial Business Questions & Objectives**

Before building the dashboard, the following key business questions guided the analysis:

1. **What is the total sales performance compared to the budget?**
2. **Which product categories and subcategories contribute the most to revenue?**
3. **Who are the top customers by sales?**
4. **Which products are selling the most?**
5. **How do monthly sales trends compare to the budgeted amounts?**
6. **Can sales performance be sliced by different filters like year, month, customer city, product category, etc.?**

These questions were critical in driving data-driven decision-making and providing stakeholders with actionable insights.

## üß© **Steps Taken in Building the Analysis**

### 1. **Data Preparation with SQL**

* Before importing data into Power BI, I used **SQL queries** to:

  * Filter and clean the raw data.
  * Join relevant tables (e.g., sales, customers, products).
  * Pre-aggregate some metrics to improve performance in Power BI.
  * Exclude unnecessary columns or records, ensuring a focused dataset.

This SQL layer ensured that the data model imported into Power BI was clean, efficient, and ready for analysis.

### 2. **Data Modeling in Power BI**

* Established relationships between tables using primary/foreign keys.
* Built a star schema model with fact and dimension tables.
* Created custom **DAX measures** for:

  * Total Sales
  * Budget vs. Actual Comparison
  * Monthly Trends
  * Top Customer/Product Analysis

### 3. **Designing Visualizations**

Each visual answered a core business question:

* **KPI Card:** Total sales vs. budget with variance and growth indicator.
* **Donut Chart:** Sales distribution by product category.
* **Bar Chart:** Subcategory sales breakdown (e.g., Road Bikes, Mountain Bikes).
* **Line Chart:** Monthly sales vs. budget comparison.
* **Top 10 Customer/Product Charts:** Identify key revenue contributors.

### 4. **Interactive Slicers**

Slicers were added to empower user-driven insights:

* üìÖ **Year & Month Slicers:** Select specific timeframes.
* üåÜ **Customer City Slicer:** Regional performance analysis.
* üõçÔ∏è **Product Category / Subcategory / Product Name Slicers:** Drill down into product-level performance.

Slicers enhanced user interactivity, making the dashboard dynamic and customizable for different stakeholder needs.
